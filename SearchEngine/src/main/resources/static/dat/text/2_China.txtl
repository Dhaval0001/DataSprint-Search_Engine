Selecting the lotus root is a very particular art: first, the lotus root should be glutinous rather than too crispy so that it will soften and taste sweet once cooked; second, do not use the lotus root head or tip because the head is too tender while the tip has a fishy smell. In Hubei, Honghu lotus root is considered the most delicious, and the best time to eat it is after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Check out next the 20 most popular Chinese desserts.
