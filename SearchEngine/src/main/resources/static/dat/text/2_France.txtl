Cr√™pes Cr√™pe is a type of very thin pastry and usually made of two types: sweet cr√™pes (cr√™pes sucr√©es) and savory galettes (cr√™pes sal√©es). They are served with a variety of fillings, from the simplest with only sugar flamb√©ed cr√™pes Suzette or elaborate savory galettes like the ham, egg, and cheese being one of the most popular. While cr√™pes are often associated with Brittany, a region in the northwest of France, their consumption is widespread and known worldwide. 2. Confit du Canard (Duck confit) Confit de canard is a tasty French dish of duck ‚Äì although goose and pork can also be used ‚Äì and is considered one of the finest French dishes. The meat is specially prepared using a centuries-old preserve and slow-cook process (confit), where the duck meat is marinated in salt, garlic, and thyme for up to 36 hours and then slow-cooked in its own fat at low temperatures (an alternative to deep-frying). It is typically served with confit roasted potatoes and garlic on the side. Today this French dish is served all over France, although it is considered a specialty of the Gascony region. 3. Coq au Vin (Rooster with wine) This quintessential French food was popularised by Julia Child through her television show and book and seen as one of her signature dishes. It is a dish of chicken braised (pot roasted) with wine, mushrooms, salt pork or bacon (lardons), mushrooms, onion, often garlic and sometimes brandy. Although the name translates as ‚Äòrooster or cock in wine‚Äô ‚Äì and braising is ideal for tougher birds ‚Äì the recipe usually uses chicken or capon. A red Burgundy wine is typically used, although French regional variations exist using local wines, for example, coq au vin jaune (Jura), Coq au Riesling (Alsace), Coq au pourpre or Coq au violet (Beaujolais Nouveau) and Coq Au Champagne (Champagne) 4. Boeuf Bourguignon (Beef stew) Boeuf bourguignon is a traditional French meal that has become internationally well-known. Coming from the same region as coq au vin ‚ÄìBurgundy (or in French, Bourgogne) in east France ‚Äì beef bourguignon has several similarities. The dish is a stew made of beef braised in red wine, beef broth and seasoned with garlic, pearl onions, fresh herbs, and mushrooms. This recipe is just one example of how traditional peasant dishes have been adopted into haute cuisine; the method of slowly simmering beef in wine was likely developed to tenderize tough (or cheap) cuts of meat. Traditional preparation time is two days to tenderize the meat and intensify the stew flavors. In Burgundy in late August, the F√™te du Charolais celebrates the prized Charolais beef with music, meat, and b≈ìuf bourguignon. 5. Ratatouille Ratatouille is another globally known French dish, hailing from the southeastern French region of Provence. It is a stewed vegetable recipe that can be served as a side dish, meal or stuffing for other dishes, such as crepes and omelettes. The vegetables are generally first cooked in a shallow pan on high heat with a small amount of fat, and then oven-baked in a dish. French chefs debate the correct way to cook ratatouille: some do not agree with sauteing all vegetables together, such as Julia Child, and argue the vegetables should be cooked separately and layered into the baking dish. The ingredients consist of tomatoes, garlic, onions, zucchini, eggplant, carrots, bell peppers, basil, marjoram, thyme and other green herbs, such as Provence herbs. A similar dish popular in the French Basque country is piperade, which typically adds ham and sometimes eggs to the stewed vegetable mix. 6. Soupe a l‚Äôognion (Onion soup) This is a traditional French soup made with onions and beef stock, usually served with croutons and melted cheese on top. The soup‚Äôs origins can be traced as far back as the Romans ‚Äì typically a poor dish ‚Äì although the current version dates from the 18th century. The remarkable taste in French onion soup is from the caramelization of the onions, to which sometimes brandy or sherry is added at the end of the slow-cook process. The liquid is typically meat stock, although variations include using just water, adding milk or thickening it with eggs or flour. 7. Steak Tartare It became a popular dish in the west after it evolved to what we know it as today. Steak Tartare is a dish whose main ingredient is raw beef or raw horse meat, usually, cut into small cubes with a knife and combined with raw egg, capers, pickles and other seasonings. The adaptation of the extra garnishes most likely originated in Germany, Steak Tartar was most probably introduced to them by the Russians who learned the dish from their Tatar conquerors. The name associated with Tartar is believed to have come from the Latin word Tartarus meaning hell, the Romans considered the Ta-ta people of central Asia (a nomadic group of Genghis Khan‚Äôs army) to be savage and barbaric and because of their bloodthirsty reputation, they inserted an ‚Äúr‚Äù in their name, thereby linking them with Tartarus (or hell). 8. Quiche Lorraine Although quiche is now considered a classic French dish, it actually originated in Germany. It started in the medieval kingdom of Lothringen, under German rule, which the French later renamed Lorraine (sound familiar!). The word ‚Äòquiche‚Äô is from the German word ‚Äòkuchen‚Äô, meaning cake. The original ‚Äòquiche Lorraine‚Äô was an open pie with a filling comprising an egg and cream custard with smoked bacon. It was only later that cheese was added to the quiche Lorraine. If you add onions, you have quiche Alsacienne. The bottom crust was originally made from bread dough, but that has long since evolved into a short-crust or puff pastry crust. 9. Macarons French macarons are delicate cookies with a crunchy exterior and weightless interior. They have a nougat-like, chewy texture and can be filled with anything from frosting and caramel to curd and ganache A macaron is a sweet meringue-based confection made with egg white, icing sugar, granulated sugar, almond powder or ground almond, and food coloring and can be found in a wide variety of flavors that range from traditional (raspberry, chocolate) to unusual (foie gras, matcha) 10. Tarte Tatin (Apple Pie) They say this French apple tarte was made by mistake in 1898 by Stephanie Tartin when trying to make a traditional apple pie. When she accidentally left the apples in sugar and butter too for long in the pan, in a hurry to rescue the desert she put the pastry base on top of the burning fruits and placed the pan in the oven. She supposedly served the upside-down tart to her guests at H√¥tel Tatin and the result turned into the hotel‚Äôs signature dish. Although the tarte‚Äôs origin is disputed, the delicious result is not. Get ready for your trip!
