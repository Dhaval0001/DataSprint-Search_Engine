Additional ingredients including  onions pineapple, and green pepper also work to complete this signature meal, leading it to become one of the most popular dishes in China. Peking Roast Duck Created for the Ming Dynasty, Peking roast duck has since become a common delicacy enjoyed in Beijing, China. Seasoned before being oven-roasted, Peking duck is often served right out of the oven with its signature crisp and golden-brazed skin still intact. Served with the duck, bringing the dish together, is sides of spring onion, cucumber, and sweet bean sauce. Mapo Tofu Mapo Tofu is the real deal when it comes to spicy and spice lovers alike, establishing itself as one of the most popular dishes in China.

Chinese Hot Pot A Chinese hot pot, also known as a steamboat, is a dish defined by its preparation method: simmering a pot of soup stock along with other raw ingredients, allowing it to cook at the dining table itself. This method of Chinese cuisine, a tradition brought down from noble banquets, has now become a common dish to tie together any family and communal meal. Spring Rolls Spring rolls are the perfect side dish, so it is completely understandable why they have become synonymous when we think about other Chinese dishes and Chinese cuisine. Once consumed as a seasonal snack at spring festivals, these fried and savory rolls filled with cabbage, vegetable, or other meat fillings have become a crispy and tasty addition to any main. Wonton Soup Originating in Northern China, wontons are a type of dumpling draped in egg yolk wrappings, covering cooked and savory meats or seafood filling.

This bowl of warmth is the perfect comfort food, allowing it to be sought after year-round and around the world. Chicken Fried Rice Cooked in a wok or frying pan, this dish tosses fried rice with egg, vegetables, and chicken over steamy temperatures. Often made with local ingredients, chicken fried rice can be made in countless variations, sometimes not including chicken at all, allowing for substitutes like seafood or other proteins creating room for artistry and experimentation.
