While you’re here you really should try some of it! From meat you don’t normally find in other supermarkets to chocolate biscuits, to the most common Australian food you should try even though, in my opinion, you probably shouldn’t because some of it is disgusting (Vegemite I’m looking at you!) Popular Australian Food 1. Vegemite Vegemite is the most common one that ‘foreigners’ discover, and more often than not, hate! No matter how many people tell you it’s disgusting you should try it at least once. I’m assuming it’s an acquired taste… So what is Vegemite? Vegemite is a dark brown paste made from various vegetables, yeast extract and spice additives. It’s a bit like marmite in the UK which had the famous love it or hate it advert as they acknowledged that it’s not to everyones taste. The most popular way to eat it is on bread or toast with butter. Australians also eat it with avocado, melted cheese or tomato. I’ve tried Vegemite and it not only looks and smells disgusting it also tastes disgusting. I thought it would taste like syrup, but it tastes very salty and not sweet at all. You, however, might be one of the many people that love it. 2. Fairy Bread Now this one is really strange and you probably won’t come across it unless you happen to find yourself at a kids party. Fairy Bread is simply white bread with butter sprinkled with hundreds and thousands! By No machine-readable author provided. Jellyfish juice assumed (based on copyright claims).

I ate my first Tim Tam after a sea kayaking tour and I loved it! If you eat one, it’s hard not to eat a second or third! I think you must become addicted. From one of the sea kayak guys I heard that the best way to eat them is the Tim Tam slam: bite the diagonal corners off the Tim Tam and take a cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate. Use the Tim Tam as a straw and suck the drink through the biscuit. Then before it gets too soggy, and falls into your drink, you eat the soft, gooey (warm!) chocolatey goodness. MMM.

Meat Pies For most Americans this next popular Australian food is very peculiar (it was even an eating challenge on one season of the Amazing Race and the competitors were retching because they thought it was so disgusting!) So what is this food that Americans think is so awful? It’s the classic Aussie Meat Pie! (I know… for a lot of us it’s not that strange a concept, however Americans are used to their pies having fruit in them and eating them as dessert so I suppose it is a bit weird to eat a meaty dessert!) Pies are a popular snack to eat on the go and almost every corner shop, bakery and supermarket will have a display case with lots of hot meaty pies to choose from. There are even specialty pie shops! Australians have many different savoury pies you can buy, however they are usually stuffed with minced meat, gravy, mushrooms, onions and cheese. It’s also a good snack after a long night of partying (better than a kebab!). After drinking and dancing you end the night with a meat pie in your hand, sitting on the pavement waiting for your taxi to go home. Image By Alpha [CC BY-SA 2.0], via Wikimedia Commons 5. Anzac Biscuits ANZAC stands for the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps that fought together during WWI. ANZAC Day is a public holiday in Australia to celebrate the men that fought for the country. During the war, the wives baked these delicious ANZAC biscuits to send off to their men at war. They were cheap to make and could stay fresh throughout long boat journeys. They are made with coconut, golden syrup and oats… yum! (Never call these Anzac Cookies as that will upset Aussies more than you can imagine!) Image By me (w:User:pfctdayelise) (Image taken by me using Casio QV-R41) [CC BY-SA 2.5-2.0-1.0], via Wikimedia Commons 6. Chicken parmigiana Ok, I know this doesn’t sound particularly Australian, but this is one of the most common foods you’ll find in an Australian pub. Loads of pubs have a parma night where you can grab a decent priced chicken parma with a beer. A chicken parma is basically a chicken schnitzel (chicken in breadcrumbs), topped with a tasty tomato sauce with melted cheese on top. By Tristan Kenney, CC BY 2.0, via wikimedia commons 7. Fish and Chips Australians do a bloody good Fish and Chips. OK most English visitors will be quite skeptical of this statement when it comes to Fish and Chips because Australians have yet to master the art of mushy peas, chips and gravy. But considering that the entire country is surrounded by ocean, you are pretty much guaranteed to always get a delicious and fresh piece of fish. Image By Steven Lilley (originally posted to Flickr as Fish ‘n’ Chips) [CC BY-SA 2.0], via Wikimedia Commons 8. Pavlova The Aussies and the Kiwis have forever fought for the title as the “inventor’ of the Pavlova – a meringue cake base topped with whipped cream and fruit. Regardless of its origin, the pavlova is absolutely delicious! You are most likely able to find a Pavlova in a Cake Shop or Bakery. You can also buy them pre made from most major supermarket chains (look in the bread or frozen dessert section). pixabay 9. Beetroot “Bloody beetroot” is something I muttered often when travelling around Australia because I can’t stand it! Unfortunately for me Aussie’s put beetroot on their burgers and sandwiches, in salads and often just on the side of the plate. Yuck! By Lcmortensen [CC BY-SA 3.0 or GFDL], from Wikimedia Commons 10. Witchetty Grub If you really want to experience some proper Aussie Bush Tucker – then a Witchetty Grub is the way to go. These little fellas taste a little like chicken and contain just as much protein as an entire piece of steak! Aboriginal Australians have eaten these for years and the nutritional benefits may just help you to overcome the gooey texture. Image By User:Sputnikcccp (Wikipedia en) [GFDL or CC-BY-SA-3.0], via Wikimedia Commons 11. BBQ’s When you think of Australia you think of surfing, nice weather, kangaroo’s and the barbecue. “Throw another shrimp on the barbie” is a quote often said even though Australians call them prawns and not shrimps! In fact, many Aussies dislike this phrase and claim that it’s just another Australian stereotype. A typical Aussie barbecue is with sausages, burgers, steak, fresh seafood, bread and tomato or barbecue sauce, they sometimes include salad but it’s mainly about the meat and fish (and of course a few stubbies – that’s beer to the non-Australians). Australians will literally have a barbeque anywhere, not just at home. Local councils provide barbeques for the general public to use at popular tourist spots like beaches. (Just clean up after yourself!) When you’re staying in a hostel or you meet some locals, you’re sure to have at least one barbeque a week! 12. Kangaroo While visitors usually take pictures of kangaroos bouncing around, the kangaroo is also a common meat to be found on supermarket shelves and restaurant menus. Kangaroo is lean red meat, it’s healthy and you can prepare it in many ways – steaks, burgers, sausages, and much more. I’ve tried kangaroo meat with a nice marinade and it was delicious! With a tasty marinade it is definitely recommended if you want to try it once. CC BY-SA 3.0, wikimedia commons 13. Emu Like the Kangaroo, the Emu can be found on the Australian Coat of Arms. Might be odd to eat your national emblems but there you go! By Squiresy92 including elements from Sodacan – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, via wikimedia commons 14. Barramundi You’ll be hard pushed to travel around Australia and not see Barramundi on the menu at least once. Barramundi is the Aboriginal name for this type of sea-bass found in Australia and the Indo-Pacific. Barramundi literally translates as “large-scaled silver fish”. You have to try this fish, it’s very popular for good reason – it’s delicious! Barramundi by flickr 15. Lamingtons If you like coconut you’ll love this very Aussie food – the Lamington. A Lamington is basically a square of sponge cake covered in chocolate sauce or sometimes raspberry sauce and then covered in coconut. To begin with I avoided these because I thought they sounded disgusting as I’m not so keen on coconut, however they’re really nice with a cup of tea in the afternoon! By Spacekadet at English Wikipedia (Transferred from en.wikipedia to Commons.) [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons 16. Avocados Don’t get me wrong, I do enjoy an avocado now and then (usually as a Guacamole as a side to my nachos). But Australians LOVE their Avocados – especially with their eggs and breakfast dishes. In most cafes you will notice that you can order a side of avocado with your poached, scrambled or fried eggs. You may even notice that the avocado is already included within the breakfast dish. I tried an avocado for breakfast for the first time, smeared on toast and topped with Rocket, Feta and Tomatoes. It was actually quite delicious! Aussies also have a fondness for avocado and Vegemite on toast… don’t knock it until you try it. Image By Kjokkenutstyr (Avocado on Board – Flickr) [CC BY-SA 4.0], via Wikimedia Commons 17. Golden Gaytime Everyone in Australia loves a Golden Gaytime… But what is it? Golden Gaytime is an ice-cream made by Streets (with a suspiciously familiar logo). It’s toffee and vanilla ice-cream dipped in chocolate and then covered in biscuit pieces. There are also a few other flavours available including ‘Unicorn’ and ‘Pina Colada’. Go on treat yourself and a friend to one because as Streets themselves say “It’s hard to have a Gaytime on your own”. Picture by Paul-in-London on Flickr 18. Milo Milo is basically a chocolate powder that can be mixed with water or milk to make a chocolate drink or it can be sprinkled on cakes etc. You can now buy pre-made milo drinks and other snacks, it being available in snack form is the only reason it made it on this list, however you should try to buy it in the iconic green tin. You can find Milo in several countries but it was an Australian who originally invented it before Nestle started selling it. By Hughesdarren – Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, via wikimedia commons Wherever you go in the world I think you should always try the traditional local food at least once. You may hate it but then again you may discover your new favourite thing! (Shame they don’t sell Kangaroo in Holland!) Ready to try one of these ‘delicious’ Aussie Foods?

        Preview Australian Food, the Most Iconic Australian Cuisine 200 thoughts on “Australian Food, the Most Iconic Australian Cuisine” Vegimite Fan! says: February 1, 2018 at 8:15 pm Hi im an Australian and I feel the reason most people in the world don’t like vegimite is because they grow up with Nutella, honey ect which is all sweet. Vegimite is a savoury spread and I feel it’s hard for some to get used to. It’s a lot yummier when you grow up with it (and use little) 😂 no hate just a suggestion to put into the world Reply Shelley Moore says: July 12, 2018 at 11:43 am I’m an Aussie living in the UK, and I was brought up on Vegemite.

BTW I am Australian!! Reply Cheyanne says: February 25, 2020 at 3:57 pm Lol I can eat 3 jars a day with a big table spoons. and really AVACADOS R NOT AUSSIE Reply rotouty says: June 16, 2020 at 10:42 am so true Reply Marjorie Ojagan says: July 17, 2020 at 8:26 am You right… I am a Filipina but I love Vegemite.. Reply Sam says: November 3, 2018 at 7:28 pm and they pile the Vegemite on thickly, which I find most Aussies I know spread it fairly thin Reply Liam says: December 4, 2018 at 9:41 pm Why do Americans eat it on a f#$!ing spoon! For heaven sake mate Reply unknown says: June 14, 2019 at 11:34 pm because there americans mate Reply Terry Collins says: October 13, 2019 at 3:51 am does anyone know what dimmies are?

Reply Barry Gattenhof says: April 8, 2020 at 10:57 pm @Liam…my dad was told to eat it off a spoon many years ago by his doctor because he obviously needed vitamin B and it is a good source of it. He also ate it thick as do i with butter on fresh bread rolls. Reply James says: April 23, 2020 at 3:46 am hey that’s offensive i have never had vegemite Reply Alex Battersby says: February 6, 2019 at 10:24 pm i think its also the fact that they eat it out the jar with a spoon.😂 Reply the bloody Aussie says: April 27, 2019 at 6:16 pm americans Reply nina says: November 23, 2019 at 1:02 am hey! we eat exotic too Reply the bloody Aussie says: April 27, 2019 at 6:15 pm totally agree with you you are to get your Coles brand butter spread it lightly on wonder white bread and then spread you bautifullvegimite Reply DJ says: May 15, 2019 at 6:55 am Dude, my Aussies don’t spell “Vegimite” like this, weeee spell it like this: VEGEMITE. 😉 Reply Dr. Don Claybrook says: May 24, 2019 at 4:35 am I’ve tried vegemite but not axle grease. I know not what the latter tastes like, but I’d give it a go if I were dying of hunger if those two were my only choices. But, there’s no accounting for taste! Reply a horrible monster says: May 24, 2019 at 11:41 pm you horrible monster!! and I should know Reply Coco lala says: July 17, 2019 at 8:22 pm I love vegemite and I don’t think I could survive with it, I am surprised that fairy bread is no2 on the list because I don’t really eat it that much, I have never had chicken parmigiana before so I’m not sure about that part, though bbq is definitely Aussie and deserves top three. I would put it 1. Vegemite 2. BBQ 3. Tim tams They are the most Aussie and most common food for me, I don’t think I have had a day without vegemite or marmite (when I go to uk) I find it funny how I haven’t ate some of the foods on the list and I have lived in aus all my life. I loveeeeeeee pavalova and mango sorbet for Christmas lunch, I told my uk friends and they looked at me and laughed (thinking I was joking) 🥭🥑🍒🥞🌭🍺🥧🥓🥩🍴🍽🧂 Reply Sofia says: October 1, 2019 at 12:14 pm Can i buy Vegemite in USA? I will love to try , also Tin Tan Reply Myrna says: February 28, 2020 at 7:42 pm Yes.You can purchase Vegemite in the States. You can get Tim Tam biscuits as well. Reply Addie says: April 27, 2020 at 2:43 am you can get them in so many places, you can get them in Canada Marianne says: September 22, 2020 at 12:03 am I bought TimTams from the World Market in the US Reply Devean says: April 22, 2020 at 2:25 pm C’mon now @Coco lala you haven’t had chicken parmi and you’re an Aussie, your better then this Reply Debbie says: April 30, 2020 at 1:44 pm I’m not sure why everyone says chicken parm. I don’t like chicken parm. I have gone to local pub for 30+ years & always get chicken schnitzel with chips, heaps of gravy and I squeeze lemon over it! Chicken parm wasn’t even an option 5+ years ago! Love vegemite!! Vegemite on toast & a cup of coffee or hot Milo gets your morning started !! 🇦🇺🦘🇦🇺🦘 Reply Anthony Bradley says: August 31, 2020 at 5:38 am My father was in England for ww2 and when he came home we had different food from England and Vegemite was one thing we had and it is very good I guess you have to had it as a kid, I still like Vegemite every day Reply Judith Ryan says: July 26, 2019 at 2:09 am It’s important to spread vegemite very thinly. Make toast, spread while still warm with butter or butter substitute, also spread very thinly, and then add a scraping of vegemite on top. Never slather vegemite on thickly. It’s not peanut butter. Reply Barry Gattenhof says: April 8, 2020 at 11:06 pm Sorry Judith but VEGEMITE on a fresh bread roll has to have plenty of butter and plenty of vegemite…..only way to eat it. Everyone has different tastes thankfully. Try vegemite on your next piece of steak when cooking it. Reply vegemite super fan!!!!!!! says: September 9, 2019 at 2:53 pm vegemite is an aussie treasure and can be consumed in any way such as on a spoon ,toast,bread,saladas and many more so each to theyre own and happy eating Reply bobbie Ranatiskeen says: September 15, 2019 at 4:05 pm I so agree! Travelers are always saying it tastes crap when it tastes so delicious!!!! AUSSIES RULE!!!!!! Reply Jeni says: September 25, 2019 at 9:38 am I plan on trying it soon!!! I have always been a huge fan of Australia and everything about the country!! Reply BruhOfficial says: October 29, 2019 at 11:15 am and because they shovel it into their mouths when they should spread it on toast Reply merilia francois alexzandra says: November 13, 2019 at 6:35 am i agree Reply Jan says: November 20, 2019 at 4:55 pm no i disagree Reply Jenny says: November 18, 2019 at 4:51 pm An Aussie who can’t spell Vegemite That’s a worry Reply Lani says: January 1, 2020 at 1:24 pm All very true and for those who think it is too salty you can get a reduced salt version. Much nicer and will not burn your tongue if your spear it too thick. Leaves promite (Yank) and marmite (Pommie) for dead. Pies are not only made with mince quality pies are made with beef chunks. There are also chicken and veggie pies, curry pies to name just a few. Agree this is a p… poor blog. I actually found it full of mistakes and offered dice to Aussies. Also ANZAC and ANZACs have a much deeper and long lasting meaning for Aussie’s and our Kiwi cousins than the original ANZACs of WW1. It speaks to the close bonds between our two great nations. It also comes into play with our sporting rivalries. Bush tucker is far more than witchety grubs. Bush tucker is a vast array of native fruits (think native finger limes for a start), native seasonings and vegetables and all delicious bar the Witcher grubs, that have found there way into modern Australian homes and restaurants. Quite a few of the phrases and words used have only partially or poorly explained. As I said it is p… poor. Now translate that one. I apologise to those readers who really want to understand and not take the p… or as the poms would say take the Mickey. Reply Kate says: January 1, 2020 at 7:17 pm Hi Lani, thanks for your comments – feel free to suggest more of the most iconic and popular food available in Australia or let me know better phrasing or explanations I can use to replace the Dutch authors phrasing. Please bear in mind that this is not a definitive list of all of the food available in your country as that would be an extremely long article and it would be hard to describe all food as the ‘most popular’ or ‘most iconic’. This article only covers some of the most popular food and iconic food that backpackers come across when visiting Australia. Reply Yusuf says: March 13, 2020 at 7:41 am They eat different from us! Reply Matty says: February 26, 2020 at 8:43 pm Most people hate Vegemite because they are expecting something sweet. It is exactly the same with any and all food. Go in with an open mind, or, expect a salty / savoury flavour. Beefy, etc. Vegemite is very salty, mostly that is umami, aka the fifth taste (salty, sweet, bitter, sour, and umami) amplifying the taste of salt. Only use a VERY, VERY small amount (seriously the tip of a knife is enough, no more). Spread it over some toast with melted butter. Expect to taste mostly butter, with a SLIGHT taste of salt / umami). Reply Nerd1.1.1 says: February 27, 2020 at 11:25 am NERDDDDDD. I love vegimite. i developed the liking towards it because eating it would make people gag and me laugh at them Reply meep123 says: March 27, 2020 at 11:48 am yes and then when they try vegimite they put way to much Reply I agree says: April 2, 2020 at 10:49 am Honestly, yes!! People from overseas dont know how to use vegemite properly, and its so stupid cause they take massive spoonfuls thinking oh yeah, this is going to be sweet! Than they spit it out and say, how do Australians eat this! Plus those videos don’t give them butter with it or anything. Basically, I totally agree with you! Reply Melissa says: May 20, 2020 at 9:49 am Also, people eat vegemite wrong. It is meant to be with toast and butter. And a thin layer of vegemite. Still, people criticise us for eating it. Reply Charli says: July 17, 2020 at 9:10 am yes hahaha Reply Billlllly bob boi says: August 12, 2020 at 10:49 am Can I just say what the hell is Barramundi I have been in Australia my whole lifE never herd of it 😹 Reply Himan says: August 12, 2020 at 3:24 pm What is the name of the thing where you put bread and a sausage inside I keep forgetting but it’s soooooooongoooooodddd Reply clara havard says: February 10, 2018 at 1:24 am this food looks ok Reply Trixie says: August 28, 2018 at 10:46 pm Popo Reply Aidan says: October 9, 2018 at 2:44 pm Good job for the information. Reply Loop says: October 30, 2018 at 4:41 am The food is way better than ok Reply Elizabeth says: February 26, 2018 at 10:00 pm Don’t smother your toast or bread with vegimite put about a quarter of a teaspoon of it on . Reply Liam says: December 4, 2018 at 9:43 pm I put on about 2 tablespoons and love it ins Sydney NSW Reply vegemite super fan!!!!!!! says: September 9, 2019 at 2:55 pm thats more like it Reply EeveeEskimo369 says: March 16, 2018 at 10:08 am The only reason MOST people don’t like vegimite is because they put too much when they apply it I personally don’t like it anyway, and I’m australian but I do take it with toast and butter when there isn’t anything else Reply jerry says: October 24, 2018 at 11:09 am you’re an Australian disgrace Reply Khye says: November 26, 2018 at 12:11 pm lol he is too Reply Pingback: The flavors of 7 world cuisines, visualized – 2 Traveling BOB says: May 3, 2018 at 2:27 pm HAPPY OSTRALIA DAI Reply 9iddsjm0 says: October 29, 2018 at 1:00 pm its australian day.. Reply Henrietta says: May 5, 2018 at 1:17 pm Once you eat vegemite a few times you get used to the salty flavor and it becomes quite delicous. Personally, I’m Australian and when i was younger my mother made me have vegemite sandwiches at school. Now i love them. Reply Mauola says: May 21, 2018 at 8:59 pm sorry, i need three more australia food lease Reply aiden says: May 23, 2018 at 6:54 am People don’t know how to eat Vegemite, it is to be eaten on toast. Normal Americans don’t understand this. Reply Goldenfoxx says: December 30, 2018 at 11:10 am Princess Cruise Line always has Vegemite in the buffet. I opened the jar and took a whiff of it and about passed out! It’s brown and looks likes and smells like something inside had died. No thank you. I was hoping the meat pies would look and taste like American pot pies. Guess I’ll have to pass on those too. No kangaroo for me either. Kangaroos are giant rodents. Everything else looks okay. I think I’ll stick to salads. Only way to mess up a salad is to serve only Iceberg lettuce. Reply George says: March 19, 2019 at 2:10 pm A Kangaroo is more akin to a deer in habit and diet and taste. A macropod, not a rodent. Reply Aussie_87 says: June 6, 2019 at 2:31 am You know, kangaroos and humans are partially related? We even share the same genes as them with only a few differences. If you’ve ever truly observed a kangaroo, I think you’ll find that there are some big similarities to humans, particularly with the males!

Kangaroos are intelligent, observant and curious animals..Kangaroos care for their young, they mourn their dead, the male kangaroos flex their muscles like body builders. Young males will fight each other for dominance. Reply Nick says: April 17, 2020 at 9:01 am You are rude. And your not supposed to eat vegemite on it’s own!!! Your supposed to have it thinly on toast with butter! And just because a food is unusual doesn’t mean is disgusting. America has a food called “deep fried butter” which IS disgusting because it is grossly high in fat. So just because you snorted vegemite doesn’t make it gross. You should respect culture other than your own. I am an Australian and I find what you say offensive.

Reply Christopher Lees says: May 31, 2019 at 2:14 pm Vegemite is a savoury topping for toast. Spread it thinly, and dilute it with either butter/margarine or cream cheese. I grew up with Vegemite and I can’t believe these Yanks who try to eat it from the jar… there’s a reason why it comes in such small jars, you use it sparingly. Alternatively, try Vegemite Cheesybite which is pre-mixed with cream cheese. Some other honourable mentions: Damper, which is a simple bread they used to make in the bush and still often made at home, as it’s super easy to make Iced VoVos, a biscuit popular mainly with the older generation topped with pink fondant and jam and coconut Chicko Rolls, a variation of the Chinese spring roll but larger and more robust, and containing beef. Available at any fish and chip shop and most places that sell meat pies. Basically designed as a one-handed snack while watching sport. Jarrah Honey, which is produced by bees collecting nectar from the Jarrah trees of Western Australia. Tastes good of course, but is particularly prized by Chinese people for its reported health properties. Flat White, a carefully-balanced combination of coffee, milk and froth that is popular in Australia and has started to make its way overseas. Australia has a very big coffee culture.

Reply T Meek says: September 25, 2019 at 8:58 am Most Aussie’s do not eat kangaroo – they are traditionally hard to farm and animals taken from the wild can have disease (eg. worms) because they share pastures with domestic animals. Most Australian’s do not eat witchetty grubs either. So these are not iconic foods. But they are traditional Australian Aboriginal foods and as such they are an important part of our culture and identity as Australians. You need to be very careful about including Aboriginal Culture – because if you make the mistake of simply being ‘tokenistic’ you fail to respect the Aboriginal People and Aboriginal Culture, which is the opposite of what you’re trying to achieve I’m sure. And what about Kebabs, Fried Rice, Curry? What about iconic Australian food that is eaten by almost all Australians and has its roots in other cultures other than English culture? These are the sorts of articles that subtly entrench racism within our communities and we need to be very watchful. This is a multi-cultural country – our nation was build through the hard working co-operative nature of MANY cultures who came together to build a new country. Our iconic food, like us, is a colourful mix from all cultures. It’s what makes Australia great! 🙂 Reply Kate says: September 26, 2019 at 9:30 pm Hi Tiffany I’m sorry that you think this article contains subtle racism it certainly isn’t intended that way. It’s written by a backpacker for other backpackers and primarily mentions foods found in Australia that are not generally found elsewhere in the world. Most backpackers try kangaroo at some point (on tours they go on mainly) and are surprised to see it sold in the shops. The witchetty grub is also included as that, like kangaroo, is something backpackers are introduced to on tours and for British visitors on I’m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here. Kebabs, curries and fried rice are found almost everywhere in the world so are not unique to Australia (or to just a few countries) so they weren’t mentioned as a visitor can eat them anywhere. This article was also written before avocados became ridiculously popular around the world so it is was quite new, at the time, to see avocado’s on so many menu’s.

Secondly, like someone has stated most Australians don’t eat a lot of kangaroo and we certainly don’t eat a lot of emu or witchetty grubs. They are not very common foods on our menus.

Reply Eric Strohmeyer says: May 7, 2020 at 7:30 pm G’Day mates! …. Well, as an American, I am proud to say that I have quite a few friends from Australia. I do have one thing to say about this piece. To my Aussie friends, instead of taking such great offense at both the Yanks and the Canadians that might refer to the ANZAC as a “cookie” instead of a “biscuit”, I would strongly suggest that it would be much better to simply explain (without the indignation) the story behind the ANZACs. The tremendous toll that that WWI took upon Australia’s brave soldiers is not taught in US (and to a lesser extent Canadian) schools, so there is no background context for an American to understand why the discussion of ANZAC biscuits produces such impassioned debate and why it is consider a sacred food for our brother and sisters from down under. ANZACs are sold in many US Supermarkets, and are almost always sold in the “cookie” aisle. They are usually not that far from the Tim-Tams on the shelves. They almost within arms reach of the Oreo, Chip’s Ahoy, and other well known cookie brands on the shelf. There is no display signs which explaining the unique story that surrounds that item. While the label on packaging does tell the story, many American’s would not likely read all the little details on the label. So, to my Aussie friend’s, we American’s can fully appreciate the significant meaning behind the ANZAC biscuits, but you need to realize that not everyone in the world has been taught the reason why you feel so impassioned about the ANZACs…. Share the story, inform the masses, and please tone down the indignation…. . Reply Marni Pennicott says: May 12, 2020 at 11:45 am Hey guys or people which ever you prefer, anyway I’m an aussie, lived here all my life I have to say this is accurate I thought it would be some random person being an idiot but no this is correct and I have to say from a previous comment, yes we do spell it like vegemite and not vegimite, sorry but that’s just weird spelling it like vegimite. Anyway I have to recommend you come to Australia, of course after this whole covid-19 is over and we’ve recovered but Australia is a really good place to come to. And I’m sorry if this is offencive to anyone but people when tasting vegemite don’t take a whole chunk take a little bit then it will taste better. And another person I agree with further up is that I think that if you grow up with vegemite you do get used to it and like it more. And the thing with the avocados! As I said I’m an aussie and I don’t really like avos whereas my family LOVES them!! And yes all the things on the list at the very start you have to try!! So good and healthy you’ll love them!! And definitely check out our beaches and everything we’re famous for, definitely at night look up at our stars, they’re beautiful. Thanks for reading Reply Ava Peeples says: May 23, 2020 at 3:48 pm Americans are very familiar with meat pies except we call them pot pies which are popular and are readily available as a comfort food at sit-down restaurants like Marie Callender’s and Cracker Barrel and fast food joints like Boston Market. You’ll find a number of different brands of pot pies in the frozen food section of grocery stores, too. I’m an American, but I’ve visited Australia for many years and I’d say the only difference is our typical chicken or beef pot pie also has a generous inclusion of corn, peas, and carrots mixed in and aren’t as meaty; otherwise the American pot pie and the Australian meat pie taste and look basically the same. I’m not familiar with the Amazing Race episode where you mention the contestants, Americans I presume, gagged or wretched eating meat pies, but I’d have to assume it was the ingredients which caused that reaction otherwise it makes no sense as Americans love pot pies. What the contestants were required to eat was probably a meat pie made with kangaroo or even kidney, neither of which would go over well in the US and/or with Americans.
