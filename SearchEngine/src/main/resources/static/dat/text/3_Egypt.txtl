Ful Medames Tamiya Koshari Shawarma Kebab and Kofta Mulukhiyah Pigeon Egyptian Desserts Baklava Feteer Meshaltet Baba Ganoush Mahshi Besarah Alexandrian Kebdah Sayadiyah Fish Hawawshi Kanafeh Umm Ali Basbousa Baked sweet potato 1- Ful Medames The most popular street food snack in Egypt, Ful is a paste of mashed broad (fava) beans flavored with garlic and olive oil. It is labeled out of large copper pots, often into pockets of pitta bread and typically sold as an inexpensive takeaway sandwich. 2- Tamiya Another Egyptian street food staple, known elsewhere as falafel, Tamiya is made with mashed fava beans and parsley (instead of chickpeas, which are used elsewhere around the Mediterranean). It is made in the shape of flat discs rather than round balls and is typically eaten as a sandwich with salad. 3- Koshari One of the famous Egyptian dishes, A mix of rice, brown lentils and macaroni topped with fried onions and a spicy tomato sauce, koshari is normally eaten in dedicated koshari restaurants that serve the dish exclusively. 4- Shawarma Shawarma one of the tasty Egyptian dishes, it is a large cone of pressed lamb or chicken that is rotated vertically in front of a flame grill. As the meat is cooked it is sliced off and mixed on a griddle with chopped tomato, onion and parsley before being rolled in a large disc of flatbread and wrapped in foil to take away. 5- Kebab and Kofta Flame-grilled chunks of lamb (kebab) and spiced minced meat made into a sausage and grilled on a skewer (kofta) are a favorite Egyptian food meal. It is typically eaten with a simple chopped tomato and cucumber salad and a disc of flatbread. 6- Mulukhiyah It is one of the favorite dishes of Egyptians, Hard to like on the first encounter, this is a soup made from mallow leaves. Green in color, it has a thick, viscous texture. Egyptians eat it with meat such as rabbit or lamb. Fatimid Sultan Hakim found the dish so unappetizing that he had it banned in the 11th century. 7- Pigeon A traditional delicacy food, pigeons (Hamaam) are bred throughout Egypt in conical pigeon towers. They are stuffed with seasoned rice or, even better, bulgur wheat (freek) before being grilled or baked. 8- Egyptian Desserts Egyptian desserts are quite light. Mahalabiya is a delicate rosewater-flavored ground rice dessert, topped with toasted nuts and cinnamon. Um Ali is similar to the English bread and butter pudding but is less soft and spongy as it is made with local dry bread. Roz bi laban is rice pudding, which is always served cold. 9- Baklava Egyptians are big fans of the sticky for this kind of food, syrup-drenched, nut-filled filo pastries known collectively as baklava. There are numerous different kinds such as konafa, which has a cream base and a crunchy vermicelli pastry crust and Basbousa, made of semolina pastry soaked in honey and topped with hazelnuts. 10- Feteer Meshaltet One of the traditional old food, Fiteer is a light, flaky multilayered bread made from dough stretched paper-thin and folded several times. It is served stuffed with minced meat or cheese or just plain brushed with Samneh (ghee) or dusted with icing sugar. 11- Baba Ganoush While many think it was invented in Lebanon, baba ganoush is a dish you will soon find on Egyptian restaurant menus. It’s a cream of roasted eggplant, olive oil, garlic, sesame paste (tahini) and lemon, very similar in texture to hummus, which like hummus is eaten with pita bread.> 12-Egyptian Fatteh It is a dish of meat (beef or chicken), rice, garlic, and layers of dry bread soaked in broth. It is usually cooked in the oven and served with yogurt and nuts. 13- Mahshi Another great dish for vegetarian travelers. It basically consists of baked vegetables, usually peppers, zucchini or aubergine, stuffed with rice mixed with aromatic herbs (parsley, coriander…).It is accompanied by a drink sauce. 14- Besarah A creamy green puree prepared with parsley, dill, leek, ground beans, spices, green pepper and fried onions on top. A perfect meal for vegetarians. 15- Alexandrian Kebdah It belongs to the street food but it is also cooked at home. The liver is prepared with hot pepper and garlic or onion can be added.As for the sausage, it is usually cooked in different ways, but mainly with tomato sauce and hot pepper. Both are served with pickles. 16- Sayadiyah Fish A dish that is cooked mainly in coastal cities such as Suez, Portsaid, and Alexandria.It is made of white fish such as sea bass or bluefish, and cooked with yellow rice, onions, spices and tomato sauce. It is then cooked in a casserole.It is a typical Egyptian meal to be savored and enjoyed. 16- Hawawshi is a traditional food in Egypt, it’s a bread (something similar to pita bread) that is usually filled with minced meat, onion, pepper. Hawawshi is perhaps best known as a staple of home-style Egyptian cooking to make you feel good 17- Kanafeh It’s another dessert we recommend you try in Egypt. The Kanefeh is a cake prepared with some semolina noodles, similar to angel hair, which are rolled and flattened and cooked together with butter and a creamy cheese over low heat. Once ready, it is soaked in syrup and a few groundnuts are added. 18- Umm Ali This is a must-have dessert, even if you set foot in Egypt for a few minutes. Om Ali, which means Ali’s mother, is made of layers of puff pastry soaked in milk and mixed with nuts, raisins, coconut flakes, and sugar, and then baked. The baked dough with the hot milk, complemented with several different ingredients makes this a dish to remember. 19-Basbousa A tasty dessert that has crossed borders, the Basbousa is of Ottoman origin. Found in different countries, it is favored by people all over the world. The name of the delicacy changes from country to country, it is called Basbousa in Egypt. The Egyptian version is usually thin, soaked in sweet syrup, soft inside and covered with almonds and fresh cream. 20- Baked sweet potato This healthy delicacy is one of the cheapest desserts in Egypt and costs around 5 Egyptian pounds. The locals usually line up by the cart, and the sweet potatoes are baked in front of them in a wood-fired oven.

Today, there are even modernized carts that sell the sweet potato with ice cream, caramel sauce, chocolate, and nuts as toppings.
