Our only warning? You might not want to read this while you’re hungry. Find out about some of the most popular and traditional Australian dishes and, more importantly, the best places to try them. 1. Chicken parmigiana This classic Aussie chicken dish – with roots in Italian-American cooking – is a staple offering at many pub menus in the country. Whether you call it a parmi/parmy or a parma (but never a parmo), there’s huge debate about where does the best parmigiana in Australia. One contender, in terms of the holy mix of size, quality, topping and chips, is the Corner Hotel in Alexandra, Victoria. Dating back to the gold rush era, this hotel has award-winning parmas that are huge, source free-range chickens and have a house secret crumb. Eight options ranging from traditional Australian to vindaloo and the double banger await those keen to explore this sensation.

Barbecued snags (aka sausages) It’s no surprise that Aussies love to grill, and nothing is more important to a good barbie than a decent sausage – whether you’re at a mate’s place or at your local Bunnings for a sausage sizzle. Traditional Australian sausages are usually pork or beef, but if you’re feeling adventurous, there are other animals to sample. Wrap a slice of bread around your snag and top it off with some fried onions and your favourite sauce. According to the Australian Meat Industry Council’s Sausage King competition, the best beef snags are found in Nowra, NSW, and the best pork bangers come from Mawson, ACT. Start your trip here: Check flights to Wollongong Stay at Bulli Beach Buy a sausage from East Nowra Butchery 3. Lamingtons Lamington is recognised as the ‘National Cake of Australia’ after the National Trust of Queensland voted this sweet treat an Australian icon. It’s named after Lord Lamington, a former Governor of Queensland who apparently had quite the sweet tooth. The lamington is a modest square-shaped sponge dipped in chocolate and coated with desiccated coconut. Other variations include two layers and a cream or jam filling – seen by many as a vital addition. They go perfectly with a nice cup of bush tea, or maybe one of Melbourne’s world-famous coffees, and are available in all good bakeries and cafes. Although the cake is thought to have been first served in Toowoomba, the national success has seen it take off in cities across Australia. Flour and Stone bakery in Sydney’s Woolloomooloo is touted as one of the best places to sample this traditional Australian food. Start your trip here: Check flights to Sydney Stay at Taronga Zoo Buy a lamington from Flour & Stone 4. A burger with ‘the lot’ If tomato, lettuce, onions and a juicy meat patty just isn’t enough burger, then maybe you should try the Aussie gut-buster with ‘the lot’. Take a burger bun and stuff it with barbecued meat, salad, sauce and, for the Australian twist, add a slice of pineapple, some pickled beetroot and a fried egg. The perfect Australian food after a long day surfing or relaxing on the beach. Every city, or even suburb, claims to have the best burgers in Australia, so finding the very best is tricky. Somewhere to start your search may be Easey’s in Collingwood, Victoria, a bar and grill that regularly wins awards for this Australian cultural food. Start your trip here: Check flights to Melbourne Stay at The Old Mechanics Go to Easey’s for a burger 5. Pavlova Both Australia and New Zealand lay claim to inventing this famous dessert, created in honour of the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova’s cultural visit to Australasia in the 1920s. As a truly Australian after-dinner sweet, the pavlova’s crispy meringue crust, light fruit filling and whipped cream topping ensure it’s a family hit. Australian food claims on this dish go back to the 1930s and Perth’s Esplanade Hotel. While that hotel no longer exists, the city still holds a strong claim on the dessert. Where you can find the best dish is still contested, but add your voice to the ongoing debate by trying the options at Whisk Creamery, C Restaurant in the Sky or The Treasury Lounge Bar. Start your trip here: Check flights to Perth Stay at Lakeside B&B Try pavlova at Whisk Creamery 6. Meat pies You may think that a pie’s a pie, available in any flavour with any filling. However, many would lay their lives on the fact that a traditional Australian pie should be hand-sized, filled with mincemeat and gravy, and topped with tomato sauce. A gourmet version with mashed potato and mushy peas is also popular, but any other variant surely falls under a different category. In 2021, the winner of the Great Aussie Pie Competition for ‘plain meat pie’ was the Pinjarra Bakery in Pinjarra, WA. Start your trip here: Check flights to Perth Stay at Seashells Mandurah Try a pie at Pinjarra Bakery 7. Barramundi Forget about fish and chips, feast on fresh Australian barramundi, a name which means ‘large-scaled river fish’ in the Aboriginal language in the Rockhampton area. Grilled, fried or seared skin-side first, it’s a much healthier alternative to battered fish, and a cultural Aussie meal. Whether you catch your own or sit back and let someone else take care of the hard work, heading up to Queensland gets you some of the best fish in the country. Try somewhere like George’s Paragon Seafood Restaurant or The Barra Boys (both in Brisbane) to see how it should be cooked. Start your trip here: Check flights to Brisbane Stay at Adina Apartment Hotel Book a table at George’s Paragon Seafood 8. Vegemite on toast Not a particularly complicated dish, but still a much-loved serving, Vegemite on toast is great for breakfast, lunch or as an anytime snack. Similar to British Marmite, Vegemite is made from yeast extract, and actually not vegetables. Ask any Australian the secret to the perfect vegemite on toast and they’ll give you a different answer. It’s completely idiosynchratic — not only the ratio of butter to Vegemite, but also additions like cheese, avocado or honey. With that in mind, we direct you to Core Espresso on Newcastle’s trendy Darby Street. Core Espresso got national exposure for serving deconstructed Vegemite toast but ultimately this means you get to experiment with the ingredients to your heart’s content. Start your trip here: Check flights to Newcastle Stay at Noah’s on the Beach Order vegemite on toast at Core Espresso 9. Pumpkin soup Australian food isn’t all about grilled meats and seafood. There are a wide range of vegetarian dishes out there too, including a hearty bowl of pumpkin soup. Best served in the colder months, and easiest to find when you head south, there’s something incredibly satisfying about a bowl of pumpkin soup eaten by the fire. Add a Granny Smith apple, which were first grown just outside of Sydney, for an authentic Australian dish. For great soup, you want cold weather, and that’s why some online commentators are recommending a trip to Avalanche Cafe in Thredbo Village to get your pumpkin fix. Start your trip here: Check flights to Cooma Stay at House of Ullr Eat at Avalanche Cafe 10. Kangaroo Lean and tasty, kangaroo is one of the healthiest meats around, as well being a national icon. But you better like your steak blue, or at least rare, as kangaroo is notoriously difficult to cook and can dry out quite easily if left on the barbie too long. Tastewise, this traditional Australian food is closest to beef. However, kangaroo has more protein and iron than beef, and fewer calories and fat content. It’s also a good source of omega-3. Head to the Red Ochre Grill if it’s your first time tasting roo. Their menu currently has it in three styles: as carpaccio, as a fillet and smoked as part of a salad.
