A delicious Persian stew that has won everyone’s hearts and is a number one cuisine for important gatherings and parties such as weddings. Fesenjan stew is prepared from ground walnuts, pomegranate paste, and chicken or meatballs. Let me add, this stew is originally from the north of Iran and they used to cook it with duck. But nowadays, it is more common with chicken. Although this stew needs hours on low heat to be cooked, when you learn the trick you can prepare it at home as delicious as the original one. In different parts of Iran, this stew is made in different ways. The original one is neither sour nor sweet, although one of the main ingredients is the pomegranate syrup. But in some places, it is sour so they add more pomegranate syrup. And some add a little sugar to make it completely sweet. 2.Zereshk Polo Another one of the best Iranian dishes served especially at important gatherings is Zereshk Polo. And they often serve it with chicken. Zereshk Polo is prepared from the combination of barberry (Zereshk), saffron, and white rice. And in addition to its delicious taste, it has a very beautiful appearance. The golden rice grains (Saffron rice) among the white ones plus the red color of the barberries are outstanding. Zereshk Polo with chicken is one of the most delicious Iranian dishes and has gained great fame in the world. Surprisingly it is so easy to make. 3.Khoresht-e ghormeh sabzi If you ask Iranians what their favorite food is, many will probably say Qorme Sabzi! Ghormeh Sabzi stew is prepared with lots of aromatic vegetables, onion, Omani lemon, red beans (in some parts of Iran pinto beans and white beans), and sheep, veal, or lamb meat. The secret of this stew, like many Iranian dishes, is the cooking time. The longer you cook the stew at a lower temperature, the tastier it becomes. Iranians normally serve Ghormeh Sabzi with plain or saffron rice. And the experience of eating it will certainly be interesting and attractive for foreign tourists. Let me add again, this stew also originally is from the north of Iran. This green part of Iran is so blessed with nature’s kindness. Many different aromatic vegetables grow there. And some of them are the main ingredients of the original stew which gives it a heavenly fragrance. 4.Sabzi Polo or Baghali Polo ba Mahicheh Sabzi Polo, if served with meat, is one of the most popular and delicious Iranian dishes, and many Iranians and of course, foreigners love it.
