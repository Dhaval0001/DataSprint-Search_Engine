Of course, many of us also know of sashimi, tempura, and ramen. Yet Japanese food culture is much richer than that. So when visiting the country, what food in Japan should be on your bucket list? To help you decide, we've compiled this list of 32 tasty Japanese foods everyone needs to try. 1. Buta-No-Shogayaki (Ginger Pork) This is one of the most common (and tasty) Japanese dishes. Try it in many restaurants, izakaya (traditional Japanese restaurant/bar), fast food chains, and even as a bento box (a pre-prepared Japanese-style lunch) found in many grocery stores and convenience stores. The word yaki means literally “grilled.” This dish is prepared by grilling thin slices of pork dressed with a delicate sauce of mirin, soy sauce, sake (Japanese rice wine), granola oil mixed with sliced onions, and ginger. The dish makes for a fabulous quick, and tasty meal and is perfect for any season. 2. Champon This dish may look like ramen at first sight (and you could say it belongs to the same category), but it’s different and unique. So if you want to taste something traditional, don’t miss out on this dish. Champon is originally from Nagasaki, as it first appeared in a Chinese restaurant during the Meiji era (1868-1912). However, unlike the many different kinds of ramen, its noodles (specifically made for this dish) are boiled in the soup itself instead of being added later. A great seasonal dish, Champon’s ingredients vary slightly depending on the season (pork, seafood, vegetables, or any combination of these). The ingredients are fried in lard, and a soup of chicken and pig bones is later added. The result is a robust and satisfying taste that is rarely the same. In fact, not only can different versions of this dish be found in many countries in Asia but also within Japan. This creates a variety of unique styles and flavors that will keep you wanting more! 3. Edamame Okay, so they're not really a dish, but they are a wildly popular food in Japan. These are not yet mature soybeans, still in their pods. They can be served hot or cold (at times grilled instead of boiled) and are usually dressed only with salt. Edamame make for an amazing appetizer. Try a few, and you will find yourself reaching for more and more before you know it. Edamame usually accompany a meal in all izakaya, but they are almost always part of the menu in the vast majority of Japanese restaurants in Japan. 4. Fugu For those looking not only for amazing food in Japan, but also for a thrilling experience, fugu is the dish to try! The fugu is a pufferfish that is, yes, delicious, but it can also be lethal due to a toxin in some parts of its body. Fugu is usually served as sashimi or in certain kinds of Japanese nabe hot pots. The preparation of this fish, due to its characteristics, is rigidly controlled by the Japanese government. Chefs who aspire to prepare this fish must undergo at least three years of very rigorous training to get their license. Before being served, the toxic parts of the fish are removed, making it safe to serve. Interestingly, fugu liver is considered the tastiest part of the fish, but it’s also the one that can be the most poisonous. As a result, serving fugu liver was outlawed in Japan in 1984. Should you try this dish, you’ll certainly remain amazed by its taste, but do careful research before ordering it in a restaurant (and never try to prepare it by yourself).

Another one of those dishes that can be found in almost every Japanese restaurant, regardless of their style, but that many people miss. Although Chinese in origin, the varieties you'll discover during your Japan stay are often quite distinct from the original. Gyoza comes in several varieties in Japan. One of the most popular is "yaki-gyoza": the dumplings are prepared with a filling of minced pork meat, cabbage, garlic, onion, and ginger. They are then lightly fried until they become crunchy and of a nice dark-gold color. Enjoy them with a dip made with soy sauce, rice vinegar, and spicy oil. 6. Gyudon Gyudon is a mouth-watering one-dish meal of beef over rice (gyu = beef). Gyudon is a quick meal served in specific restaurants or Japanese fast-food chains such as Yoshinoya. A bowl of steamed rice is topped with thinly sliced beef and tender onion, simmered in dashi broth (a popular Japanese ingredient), and seasoned with mirin and soy sauce. Sometimes it’s served topped with a lightly cooked egg. If you want to experience a typical Tokyo office worker’s lunch break, enjoy this quick and tasty dish and get back to your tasks (although you probably won’t need to go to work, you’ll enjoy having more time to sightsee and explore on a full and satisfied stomach). 7. Gyukatsu (Beef cutlet) A wonderful beef variation of the popular pork-based tonkatsu (which we also recommend you try) is a dish of deep-fried breaded beef, usually served with cabbage, barley rice, miso soup, potato salad, and pickles. The preparation makes for a tender and crunchy texture and a very flavorful but not overwhelming taste. You won’t find this dish as easily as its pork counterpart, but if you do, you’ll be happy!

Gyutan Depending on your country of origin, this dish may appear, at a glance, too atypical, but bear with us and keep reading. Gyutan literally means cow tongue, and this is exactly what the dish is: grilled beef tongue. You can usually find this dish in yakiniku restaurants, served with salt or different sauces (usually a lemon one) and scallion. The meat is thin, tasty, and tender. Gyutan originated in Sendai, where the owner of a yakitori restaurant opened a new one in 1948, which served gyutan. Since then, the dish has spread all over the country like wildfire. Try it, and you’ll know exactly why. 5 Recommended Sendai Gyutan Restaurants: Where to Savor Japan's Outrageously Delicious Cuisine 9. Karaage As soon as you set foot in Japan, you’ll start seeing the typical Japanese fried chicken: karaage. Now, karaage usually refers to chicken, but depending on the area you eat out, other meat (like pork) may be used instead. The pieces of meat are lightly coated with wheat flour or potato starch and deep-fried in oil. Sometimes the ingredients are marinated beforehand. It’s usually served with a slice of lemon on the side, but you can enjoy it with or without it. The chicken variety is especially common in restaurants, street-food carts, izakaya, and convenience stores. Karaage is cheap, tasty, and fast. Only downside? So good, it’s addictive! 10. Katsudon Like gyudon, but prepared with pork, this is another popular Japanese food and often neglected (by foreigners) dish that is as cheap as fast and tasty. Perfect for those on the go, you can enjoy this meal in specific restaurants and all Japanese-style fast-food chains. A bowl of rice is served with a topping of deep-fried pork cutlet, egg, vegetables, and condiments. It’s a common dish in Japan, but you can find several kinds, like the one served with tonkatsu sauce, the demi katsudon (a specialty of Okayama), shio-katsudon (flavored with salt), or the miso-katsu (originally from Nagoya). Regardless of the variety, you’ll love this dish! 11. Kushikatsu This dish, also known as kushiage, is crunchy deep-fried skewered meat, fish, or vegetables. The etymology refers to its preparation, with Kushi referring to the skewers used and katsu, meaning the deep frying of a meat cutlet. Some of the more exciting kinds are prepared with bamboo shoots, lotus root, cartilage (nankotsu), and gizzard (sunagimo). They are all certainly worth tasting. On top of the different ingredients that can be used, there are also several geographical varieties, such as Osaka; Tokyo (also serving pork rib kushikatsu), where the meat is prepared slightly differently and dressed with brown sauce; Nagoya is famous for its doteni (a rich miso-based dish with beef tendon, offal, and daikon radish. Here you can order Kushikatsu with this staple dish. The region also uses different sauces and batter. How to Make Your Own ‘Kushikatsu,’ Osaka’s Deep-Fried Specialty!

This dish, served in almost any combination of breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals, is truly a staple of Japanese cuisine. Simple and flavorful, it’s a fantastic side dish to enjoy with the rest of your food. Once again, we see dashi being one of the main ingredients. This stock is mixed with miso (seasoning produced by fermenting soybeans) paste, creating the famous soup. Other ingredients are then mixed accordingly to preference. Miso soup will often be served with tofu, scallion, and wakame seaweed. Other items can be added, such as daikon, shrimp, fish, mushrooms, potatoes, onions, or meat. Particularly recommended during cold winter days, you can’t leave Japan without trying this evergreen dish! 13. Nabe Nabe means cooking pot. It’s sometimes referred to as nabemono (literally, “things in a cooking pot”). The name already tells you everything there is to know about preparation, but it can’t begin to paint a picture of the immense variety of nabe one can find in Japan. This dish can be found all year round, but it’s ideal during cold months. Popular both in Japanese nabe restaurants and at home, the dish is prepared by boiling in seasoned or unseasoned water a variety of ingredients: meat, fish, shellfish, vegetables, and tofu. Nabe is also famous as the favorite dish of Sumo wrestlers. In particular, when talking about sumo nabe, we refer to “chanko nabe.” Chanko nabe usually includes meatballs, chicken, vegetables, and noodles. It’s designed to be served with more ingredients for the wrestlers to gain weight. Another notable name in the nabe family is shabu-shabu. Shabu-shabu’s name springs from the movement one makes when dipping thinly sliced meat into the boiling pot. The dish is served with meat (usually beef and pork), as well as vegetables and tofu. The food is then enjoyed with a sesame dipping sauce or ponzu (a lemon-based dressing) or a mix of the two. Sukiyaki is a variation of shabu-shabu in which the ingredients are stewed in sweetened water and soy sauce and enjoyed with a dip of raw egg. Yose nabe (yose=putting together), as the name implies, is a variety of nabe in which all things, meaning meat, fish, vegetables, and tofu, are cooked together at the same time in the pot. It’s usually based on a soup of miso or soy sauce. The types of nabe available in Japan is truly staggering, so go look for some, experiment, and enjoy! A Complete Guide to Nabe (Hot Pot): Delicious, Traditional Winter Japanese Hot Pot Cookery 14. Natto Known as a kind of food disliked by many foreigners, natto is daily and widely consumed by most Japanese people. Many foreigners seem unable to eat natto because these fermented soybeans have a potent smell that most find unpleasant. Furthermore, its stickiness makes it a little weird for many non-Japanese. It is, though, definitely worth trying, as it’s genuinely Japanese food. Natto is often served with rice (a rolled variety easily found in convenience stores and sushi restaurants) and dipped in a few drops of soy sauce. Alternatively, it’s served with spicy Japanese mustard called karashi. We will admit that it may be hard to get used to this dish, and it’s a bit of an acquired taste, but we recommend you give natto a shot, as you may find you have more of a Japanese palate than you had thought!

This is another variety of one-pot dishes consisting of several ingredients (usually eggs, konjac, fish cakes, and daikon) served in a dashi and soy soup. While some restaurants specialize in preparing this dish, you can commonly find oden in many Japanese fast-food chains and convenience stores. Oden can be prepared in many different ways (and sometimes even its name is different. In Nagoya, for example, it may be called Kanto-ni). The soups in which the ingredients are boiled also change depending on the region. Oden is a great, cheap, and original dish that will never bore you, especially if you’re traveling through different cities in Japan. 16. Okonomiyaki If you’re visiting the country, you’ll want to try one of the many kinds of this staple dish. Hard to compare to other dishes, okonomiyaki can be considered the Japanese frittata or pancake. The name’s etymology (meaning what you like or how you like + grilled) hints at the number of different ingredients used to prepare this savory dish. The most popular varieties of Okonomiyaki are the ones from the Kansai region and the ones from Hiroshima. Kansai Okonomiyaki: This is probably the predominant version of the dish in Japan. The batter is prepared with flour, nagaimo (a kind of yam), dashi (or water), eggs, cabbage, pork belly, octopus, squid, shrimp, mochi, or cheese, and konjac. Osaka is particularly renowned, in Kansai, for okonomiyaki, as it seems the dish originated from there. Hiroshima Okonomiyaki: In this version (also known as Hiroshima-yaki or Hiroshima-okonomi), the ingredients are not mixed but arranged in layers. Usually, noodles such as yakisoba or udon, as well as eggs and lots of sauce, are added as a topping. Many other kinds of this dish exist in several areas across Japan (Tokushima, Hamamatsu, Okinawa, and more). And if you’re visiting Tokyo, you’ll have to stop by the Tsukishima district, famous for both okonomiyaki and monjayaki. The main street of Tsukishima has been renamed Monja Street. You will want to visit it to try monjayaki, a dish similar to okonomiyaki, but with a less dense texture and with different ingredients.

Omuraisu, as the name suggests, is an omelet filled with fried rice and usually topped with ketchup. The dish seems to have originated in Tokyo, in a western-style restaurant, roughly 100 years ago. You’ll find this dish in most Japanese cafes that also serve food, as well as in several restaurants. If you’re staying with friends from Japan, chances are they’ll know how to prepare it, as it’s a common dish among Japanese people. Once again, a filling, cheap, and tasty one-dish meal that will certainly be popular among adult visitors, as well as children! Sunny Side Up or Omurice? 6 Japanese Egg Dishes You Have to Try 18. Onigiri Who hasn’t seen in anime, movies, videos, or documentaries the famous Japanese rice ball, the onigiri? While not very common as a menu item in restaurants, this is the king of on-the-go dishes. You’ll find it in virtually every grocery store and convenience store. The onigiri can be a simple rice ball flavored with spices, or it can be filled (and it usually is) with various ingredients, from vegetables, to meat, fish, seafood, and more. It’s sometimes wrapped in a sheet of flavored or unflavored nori (seaweed), depending on the region and one’s preference. Many people visiting Japan eat mainly onigiri while sightseeing, given its cheap price (usually around 100 yen) and its availability and simplicity.

Ramen Most people know ramen, especially for its world-famous instant variety, but in Japan, you’ll be surprised by its fantastic taste (definitely not even comparable to its cup counterpart) and the many different choices. The broth can be based on chicken, pork, beef, fish, and vegetables, and flavored with soy sauce, miso, dashi, and many other seasonings. Usually, scallion, seaweed, tofu, and bamboo shoots are added, but it’s impossible to list all the combinations this dish can offer. Not only each region, but even each restaurant can have a different recipe, sometimes creating very original and tasty meals. The noodles are specifically made for ramen and have a distinctive texture, soft but with a bit of a bite. The most common soup stocks are miso, salt, soy sauce, and curry. Ramen is probably the most popular shime (the last meal at the end of a day or night out). It’s considered fast food, and while some kinds can be served cold, it’s usually hot, and a godsend on cold days. Ramen in Japan: All About Japanese Ramen Noodles (With Food Guide!) 20. Robatayaki Robatayaki (or robata) is a unique Japanese cuisine in which food is grilled on an irori style fireplace (wide, flat, open fireplace) over charcoal. This particular dish is usually found only in specialized restaurants, so you may have to look/ask specifically for it. The list of food at robata restaurants is everything you can think of, although traditionally it is a combination of seafood and vegetables. Most visitors miss this amazing food in Japan. Make sure you taste a real slice of Japan by looking for a good robata (there are many in Tokyo and all over Japan). Must-try Regional Hokkaido Foods: Robatayaki, Jingisukan & More 21. Soba Soba is a buckwheat noodle specialty of Japan. It’s extremely popular, and it’s served both in general noodle restaurants and in specialized (often expensive) ones. It’s also relatively simple to prepare at home, by getting the noodles and the soup in which they are dipped at a grocery store. Soba can be enjoyed in a cold dip, or a broth, as a noodle soup. This dish appears in different varieties depending on the season and the region you’re visiting. Don’t forget to ask for a soba dish next time you visit a restaurant in Japan! Honke Owariya: Inside The Kyoto Soba Restaurant That Was Founded in 1465 (And Is Still Crazy Popular) 22. Somen Somen is the Japanese version of a prevalent kind of noodle across Asia. Made out of wheat flour, it’s usually served cold. These skinny noodles are served with a simple cold dipping sauce, or with a sauce flavored with onion, ginger, and myoga (a different kind of ginger). This dish is particularly popular in summer when a dish of somen chilled with ice cubes is all you need to recharge, fill up, cool off, and take a break from the brutal Japanese summer heat.

Sushi and sashimi Of course, we all know these dishes, but we can’t avoid mentioning them in this guide. Sushi and sashimi are among the foods at the pinnacle of Japanese cuisine. While very famous worldwide, many fail to understand the variety of cuts and preparation that can go into preparing this food. Sushi chefs are regarded as artists, and most of them have to practice as apprentices for years (and at times decades) before they too can be called sushi and sashimi masters. This doesn’t mean that it’s impossible to find good quality sushi or sashimi at a fair price. Japan offers options for all palates and all pockets. An enjoyable experience is that of the rolling sushi restaurants. You order from a small tablet at your table, and the sushi is served directly to you via a rolling mat. The food is excellent, and it’s only 100 yen per dish (these restaurants are usually called 100 yen-sushi, or sushiro). Something missing outside of Japan is usually the so-called temaki zushi (lit. hand-rolled sushi). You can certainly find restaurants in which this dish is served, but you’ll love making your own at home (if you have Japanese friends, it’s pretty much guaranteed they’ll know how to do it). The preparation is simple. You’ll need sushi rice, cuts of your favorite fish (thin slices, usually), sea weed sheets, and whatever other ingredients you’d like to add, according to your taste. Often used ingredients are cucumber, crab, avocado, and wasabi. Spread the rice on a sheet of seaweed, add fish and other fillings, roll the seaweed in a cylinder or cone, and enjoy with soy sauce. If you’re in Japan, propose a “temaki zushi party,” and you’ll surely get amazing approval. 28 Best Types of Sushi You Have to Try When Visiting Japan! Browse & Book ▶ Popular sushi restaurants 24. Takowasa Takowasa is raw octopus (tako) served in a wasabi sauce (wasa). This is one of those Japanese dishes that, depending on your cultural background, may appear weird. Do try it out! Takowasa is a common appetizer in many restaurants, especially in an izakaya. It’s very popular and for a good reason. It’s tasty, unique, and a true symbol of Japanese popular food tradition. 25. Tempura Tempura is a great dish all year round, especially for those of you who enjoy sharing a few drinks with friends. Tempura consists of shellfish, fish, chicken, or vegetables covered in a flavorful batter and deep-fried until they reach a perfect crunchiness level. You can enjoy tempura as is or with dipping sauce. While many restaurants serve this dish, several specialize in it, where you can find a wider choice for an even more amazing dive into traditional Japanese food. 3 Outstanding Kyoto Tempura Restaurants You Must Visit Next Trip Browse tempura restaurants in Japan 26. Teppanyaki Teppanyaki is a lesser-known (but still delicious) Japanese cooking style. Teppan means iron plate, and yaki means grilled. Teppanyaki is a term that encompasses a large variety of dishes, including okonomiyaki, yakisoba, and monjayaki. Still, it’s usually used to refer to a particular kind of preparation of western-influenced food. Typical ingredients for teppanyaki are beef, shrimp, vegetables, chicken, and scallops. They are prepared on a hotplate, usually with soybean oil. Some of you may be familiar with this kind of cooking, as in the U.S., these restaurants are pretty popular (although known as hibachi). If you come to Japan and want to taste amazing food that espouses Japan and the west, you’ll want to give teppanyaki a shot. Browse teppanyaki restaurants in Japan 27. Tonkatsu Tonkatsu is a top-rated and easy-to-find dish of breaded pork cutlet deep-fried in vegetable oil. You can find this cheap, tasty dish in several chain restaurants and in bento boxes in grocery and convenience stores. You can even make it yourself! Season the meat with salt and pepper and cover it with flour. Then dip it into the beaten egg and add a layer of panko (Japanese flaky bread crumbs). Deep fry and serve with cabbage, potato salad, and some brown sauce or karashi. Tonkatsu is also perfect for on-the-go sandwiches, making for a fabulous quick meal. Browse teppanyaki restaurants in Japan 28. Udon Of the huge variety of noodles you can find in Japan, udon, similarly to ramen, is one of the most popular. Udon is a thick wheat flour noodle that you can enjoy in its simplest form (broth made of dashi, mirin and soy sauce), or in a variety of combinations. Try it with tempura, for a robust meal, or with tofu, for a more delicate taste. Udon can be served hot or cold, depending on the season (and on one’s taste) and it’s prepared in many styles depending on the region you’re visiting. While the word udon refers to the noodles themselves, there’s no limit to the flavors, soups, and ingredients that can be added. As a matter of fact, challenge yourself to try out as many styles of udon as you can during your visit in Japan, and not only are you going to be satisfied, but also nowhere near the end of the list of possible dishes! 29. Yakiniku Yakiniku means grilled meat and can also be referred to as Korean barbecue or Japanese barbecue. (The main difference is that meats are typically marinated for Korean-style barbecue, while in the Japanese style, they are not.) Yakiniku restaurants are wildly popular, and you can find many high-end ones, as well as more budget-friendly ones (many of which also offer all-you-can-eat menus). In yakiniku restaurants, you order the meat or vegetables that you prefer (seasoned or unseasoned). The selection is huge. Then you grill it yourself on a hot plate or grill, usually embedded within the table. You can then add sauces such as lemon, bbq, and many others, or simply salt and pepper.

Yakisoba Yakisoba, as the name suggests, is a variety of grilled soba (or noodles in general) and is a dish typically found at festivals. You can also prepare yakisoba by stir-frying the noodles. You can add pork, fish, or vegetables and garnish with seaweed powder, ginger, and fish flakes. Give a finishing touch with sauces such as oyster sauce, and thank us later! 12 Japanese Street Foods You Must Try When Visiting Japan! 31. Yakitori Although the word yakitori literally means grilled chicken, this concept encompasses all kinds of skewered meat (and vegetables) prepared on a grill. This is a simple and flavorful dish with a never-ending list of combinations, found in several restaurants and specialty shops. When visiting a good izakaya, it is especially recommended to experience another one of the truly popular Japanese foods. Phrases, Tips & More: The Complete Guide to Yakitori - Japan's famous grilled chicken skewers! 32. Yakizakana Being in Japan, we can’t leave out grilled fish. Yakizakana may not be as popular as sushi outside of Japan, but it’s arguably much more common than raw fish in this country. Usually, a whole fish is grilled and served with side dishes of various vegetables and rice. Try it in specialized restaurants for a fully immersive experience or in chain restaurants for a tasty, cheap, and fast meal that will keep you going for the several hours of sightseeing ahead of you! You’re now on the way to become a true expert on food in Japan! Yet there’s much more to Japanese cuisine that can be discovered!
