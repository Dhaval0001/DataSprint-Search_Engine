FOOD, of course! And we’ve listed the top 50 famous French foods here! It may surprise you that this famous French food list is not all haute cuisine and gourmet fare. Some of the most well known and popular French foods today actually descended from traditional peasant dishes. French Food Recognized by UNESCO as an intangible cultural heritage, the cuisine of France is undisputedly some of the best food in the world. BTW, in its entire history, UNESCO has only awarded two cuisines: French food, and Mexican food. Cooking schools worldwide teach techniques and recipes for famous French dishes (that’s what I learned). Governmental law even regulates the authenticity of certain foods in France. And gourmands travel thousands of miles to experience a myriad of famous French foods—and, yes, I am one of them! What are the most famous foods from France? French cuisine history can be complicated, with many origins in dispute, but traditional regional specialties come from every corner of the country. So, don’t settle for a mere top 10 French foods list—here are the top 50 foods France is famous for! An example of fancy French food, or haute cuisine 50 Most Famous French Foods 1. Aioli A food born in the hills of Provence, the mayonnaise-like sauce Aioli most often dresses seafood and vegetables. The name means “garlic oil,” and it’s almost that simple; add some sea salt for flavor and egg yolk to achieve the creamy consistency, and voilà. As one of the famous French foods eaten in the U.S., Americans frequently associate the term Aioli with any mayonnaise-based sauce. But in France, the craziest this Provençal sauce gets is adding a little lemon or mustard. 2. Aligot How does this sound? Mashed potatoes, minced garlic, melted cheese, and cream! This famous food in France comes from L’Aubrac in the south of France and can be traced to the 16th century. A tasty French side dish, Aligot can become extremely elastic, and some French restaurants put on quite a show stretching it to great lengths when serving it. This is a classic French dish you won’t want to miss! 3. Baba au Rhum The current version of Baba au Rhum was invented in 1835 at the oldest pâtisserie in Paris, Stohrer’s. Located on Rue Montorgueil, one of the best food streets in Paris, this bakery dates back to 1730 when it was opened by Nicholas Stohrer. History says the original version of this famous food from Paris has some Polish roots. Condensed story: An exiled Polish king brought some traditional Polish Babka (bread) with him to Paris. By the time he went to eat it, it was dry, and Nicholas Stohrer had the brilliant idea to soak it in Malaga wine. A hundred years later, one of his descendants made the switch to rum—brilliant! Baba au Rhum, a famous food from Paris 4. Baguette What is the most famous food in France? It’s the humble French food staple—the Baguette! It’s also one of the most famous French foods in America. The French take their Baguettes very seriously. Strict rules have to be abided by in order for a loaf of French bread to be called a “traditional” French baguette. For example, they must be made fresh (never frozen) on the premises, and the only ingredients allowed in addition to water are wheat flour, salt, and yeast. There is even the Grand Prix de la Baguette de Tradition Française, which is held every year in Paris. The winner supplies the presidential palace with Baguettes for a year. 5. Beef Bourguignon One of the French famous dishes from the region of Bourgogne (Burgundy), Beef Bourguignon, or Boeuf Bourguignon, combines 2 renowned ingredients of the area, beef and red wine. Originally a French peasant stew slow cooked with mushrooms, carrots, and onions, Beef Bourguignon has been elevated to haute cuisine status by French chefs at some of the Michelin-starred restaurants in Burgundy. Today it remains among the most beloved French main dishes and is an undisputed French classic! 6. Beignets Known to Americans as the official doughnut of Louisiana, Beignets were born in France. One of the top foods in France prepared for Mardi Gras, it’s no wonder the U.S. Mardi Gras capital, New Orleans, adopted them as their own. Certain regional French cuisines, especially Provençal, also feature savory Beignets made of different kinds of vegetables or zucchini blossoms. Beignets, a famous food in France and Louisianna 7. Bouillabaisse I still swoon over the memory of my first time eating the Marseille seafood stew, Bouillabaisse. Once made by fisherman from the scraps of the sea, Bouillabaisse is now one of the famous French dishes with lots of rules governing its contents and preparation. In fact, in Marseille, there’s even a Bouillabaisse Charter that was drawn up to try to maintain the integrity and authenticity of this world-famous dish. In addition to the quality and type of ingredients that need to be used—including the specific different types of fish—the Charter stipulates presentation, and that the fish be cut in front of the guest. So, if you order this classic French food at a Bouillabaisse Charter restaurant, you’re guaranteed a dinner and a show! Bouillabaisse, one of the famous French dishes from Marseille 8. Brioche Highly rich in butter and egg, Brioche falls somewhere between a bread and a pastry. However, you will see brioche more often at the boulangerie (bakery) than at the pâtisserie (pastry shop). It is a most popular food in France, as it can be enjoyed as a breakfast, dessert, or snack. You can find Brioche in loaves as well as individual buns. And they can be plain, or mixed with fruits, nuts, and/or chocolate. 9. Butter What kitchen staple is France famous for? Butter! Even on my Air France flight to Paris, the butter was so sublime that I ate my entire tub with a roll after I was full from my dinner. It was better than the desserts! Why is French butter better? The cows, what they’re fed, the churning, and the production processes all play a part. But when it comes down to it, the number one reason is higher fat content. The minimum for American butter is 80% fat, opposed to 82% for French butter. French butter sold at a cheese shop 10. Caramel au Beurre Salé My favorite candy, Caramel au Beurre Salé, or Salted Butter Caramel, was invented in Brittany by Henri Le Roux using local butter and sea salt. In 1980 the Salon International De La Confiserie named Le Roux’s delectable candy the “Best Sweet in France.” Today, this famous food of France has been imitated all over the world. And “salted caramel” has become a popular flavor for everything from ice cream (another favorite) to coffee. 11. Cassoulet Cassoulet, a traditional food of France dating back to the Middle Ages in the Languedoc region, combines white beans with pork, onions, tomatoes, and depending on the town an assortment of different meats like mutton, partridges, goose, sausages, and duck. Similar to Bouillabaisse, Cassoulet began as humble farmer fare and has risen in ranks to a fine bistro meal that is one of the most famous dishes in France. Nowadays, you can even find this traditional French food in Paris restaurants, especially the duck and sausage version. Eating the traditional French food, Cassoulet, in Carcassone 12. Charcuterie Charcuterie is the French term for prepared meat products. All sorts of Charcuterie, like sausages, hams, bacons, pâtés, terrines, and cured meats are popular foods in France. Arguably so popular, that each one could be a separate item on this famous French food list. You can order a Charcuterie board at a café in most French cities, or purchase ingredients at a butcher shop and make your own. If you’re in Paris, head to Rue des Martyrs, the best food street in Paris, for a great selection! 13. Cheese Undoubtedly one of the most famous foods in France, French cheese happens to be one of my favorite foods on Earth. Brillat-Savarin and Délice de Bourgogne stand out as two varieties that I crave often. In France, different regions produce different cheeses. Some of the most famous French cheeses include Brie, Camembert, and Roquefort (blue cheese). With over 1,000 different types of cheeses, I could easily eat some everyday—and I did the last 2 months I was visiting. What may surprise you is that it is rare to find a French dinner menu where cheese is not offered as a dessert! A display of French cheeses, always a popular food in France 14. Chicken Cordon Bleu Much controversy surrounds one of the most famous French meals, Chicken Cordon Bleu. Both the French and the Swiss claim the popular dish as theirs, and even the origin of the name sparks debates. Stuffed with ham and cheese, breaded and fried, there is one thing about this marvelous main course on which the French and the Swiss agree—Chicken Cordon Bleu is darn delicious! 15. Chocolate One of the most popular treats in France, Chocolate, is both a famous French food and drink. Actually, the first chocolate consumed in France was Hot Chocolate in 1615. And I dare to claim that Angelina in Paris serves the best Hot Chocolate in the world! If you’re visiting the City of Lights, it’s a must-try Paris food to eat on vacation! In France, master chocolatiers present Chocolate works of art that must be admired before being devoured. Whether your sweet tooth veers toward dark chocolate, milk chocolate, or white chocolate, delightful French delicacies await you. Some of the biggest brands in French Chocolate today include Patrick Roger, Valrhona, Cazenave, Hirsinger, and Richart. Hand painted French chocolates 16. Choucroute Garnie Choucroute Garnie means “garnished sauerkraut” and is the most popular French dish from the Alsace region that borders Germany. In this case, the garnish dominates the hearty meal. Usually a combination of sausages, pork of some kind (shoulder, ham, bacon, or a combo), and potatoes garnish the sauerkraut. It is so popular that we had a hard time finding plain sauerkraut in French grocery stores! 17. Coq au Vin Coq au Vin, one of the most famous dishes of France, owes much of its popularity to the French chef herself, Julia Child. Ask an American to name a French food, and you will likely see Coq au Vin as one of the most popular answers. Coq au Vin, which translates to “rooster in wine,” is the chicken cousin of Beef Bourguignon. Also hailing from Burgundy, this traditional French chicken stew uses many of the same ingredients as its cousin dish: red wine, carrots, onions, and mushrooms. 18. Cream Puffs The decadent dessert, Cream Puffs, or chou à la crème, first debuted in France in 1533. The French name, pronounced “shoo-a-la-crem,” means cabbage with cream. Make no mistake, there are no vegetables here! The name comes from the shape of the dough when it comes from the oven—the small round balls are thought to look like cabbages. The light and airy ball is then sliced and filled with cream or custard. Modern bakeries tweak the traditional recipe with different flavorings. It’s easy to understand why hundreds of years after their invention, Cream Puffs are still one of the most popular French foods! Cream Puffs, one of the most popular French foods 19. Crème Brûlée In the world of desserts, what France is famous for is Crème Brûlée! What’s not to love? A silky smooth vanilla custard with a burnt sugar crust on top. Although the recipe dates at least as far back as the 1600’s, the popularity of this French dessert exploded in the U.S. in the 1980s, and it still appears on dessert menus on multiple continents. 20. Crepes One of the quintessential foods of France, the Crepe comes from the region of Brittany in northern France. Here, savory crepes, known as Galettes, use buckwheat flour, and sweet dessert crepes use white flower. Crepes are now found throughout the country and are considered a French food staple and a popular street food. Ham and cheese, one of the French’s favorite combinations, is one of the more common savory fillings. But this popular food in France can be filled with everything from salmon to Nutella. Whatever you fill it with, the Crepe is a top food France is famous for! The Crepe, one of the quintessential foods of France 21. Croissants Hands down one of the top famous French foods, Croissants actually descended from the the Kipferl, the Austrian crescent roll that dates back to the 13th century. By 1869, Croissants were one of the most typical foods in France eaten for breakfast. Today they are still one of the most popular French breakfast pastries—with coffee, of course! 22. Croque Monsieur Spend a couple of days in Paris, and it will be evident that the Croque Monsieur is one of the most popular French foods. This crunchy, gooey, ham and cheese sandwich graces so many menus, from famous Paris cafés to the local hole in the wall. Although this traditional food in France seems like a simple recipe, each eatery has its own take on it, and some also offer the sister sandwich, the Croque Madame, which comes with a fried egg on top. The Croque Monsieur is usually served with a green salad as a side because the sandwich itself is so satisfying and filling. You usually can’t go wrong ordering this delicious dish, and it’s certainly one of the best foods in France for anyone on a budget. Croque Monsieur, a traditional French dish that is still one of the most popular French foods 23. Duck a L’Orange Of the famous dishes from France, Duck a l’Orange, or Canard à l’Orange, stands out as the classic menu item of international French restaurants. The definitive recipe, according to the French culinary encyclopedia Larousse Gastronomique, comes from the Restaurant Lasserre in Paris. This famous French restaurant has served the tender roasted duck paired with a slightly sweet-and-sour orange sauce for over 80 years, helping to ensure its place among the finest French dishes! 24. Duck Confit Definitely on my French food Top 10 list, Duck Confit, or Confit de Canard, reigns king in Gascony. Luckily, the fall-off-the-bone duck with the crispy, seasoned skin can be found all over France, many times at bargain prices. What started hundreds of years ago as a way for farmers to preserve meat through cold winters, confit, the processes of curing and storing duck in its own fat, has evolved into a traditional food France reveres. Duck Confit, one of the famous French foods from Gascony 25. Eclairs In France, popular foods will aways be found at the pâtisseries! And that goes for the classic French dessert, Eclairs. The name means “flash of lightning” because that’s the speed at which they’re eaten! Made with the same dough as Cream Puffs (choux pastry), the oblong-shaped Eclair first appeared in cook books in the 1800s. Traditionally filled with vanilla custard and topped with chocolate icing, Eclairs in modern pastry shops can be flavored with anything from passion fruit to coffee. Eclairs, a classic French dessert 26. Escargot Seen as an exotic French food by some of us in the U.S., Escargots, or snails, have been consumed by humans for 30,000 years! Their place as a French traditional food, however, began in 1814, when Czar Alexander fell in love with them while visiting France. Now most French menus list them as an entrèe (appetizer), and they have earned their spot among the cannon of French cuisine. The typical preparation in French cuisine, Escargots de Bourgogne, drenches the snails in butter, garlic, and parsley. The predominant flavor is garlic-butter and, therefore, pretty yummy. 27. Foie Gras Seared Foie Gras is one of the foods of France that I order pretty much every time it’s available—unless it’s too expensive. Translated as “fat liver,” it sounds horrible, and I even hate that I love it so much. But, in Gascony, the primary region for duck, this French food delicacy is so ubiquitous and reasonably priced, I literally ate it every day. Classic seared Foie Gras is warm with a crispy outside and silky smooth inside, and it is served with a sweet sauce and toasted bread. In France, the term Foie Gras may be used as a catch-all phrase for pretty much anything made with duck or goose liver. So, be careful when ordering. Seared Foie Gras with figs, a delicious French food delicacy 28. Fondue Savoyarde Ask someone in the French Alps what their country is famous for and they’ll say Fondue Savoyarde! Because a long time ago people crossed freely over the French and Swiss Alp borders, it is difficult to say definitively who created cheese fondue. The Swiss have their version using Swiss cheeses, and the French choose from among a variety of French cheeses, including Beaufort, Emmenthal, and Comté. Choose your Fondue mates wisely! Fondue folklore says if you drop your bread off your fork, you’ll have to buy a round of drinks or run through the snow naked! 29. Frogs Legs Monks catapulted Frogs Legs, or cuisses de grenouille, into an iconic French food. During a time of meat restrictions, the monks persuaded the Catholic Church to classify frogs as fish. When the monks started eating them, so did the peasants, and thus began the path for Frog Legs to become a traditional food from France. Do frogs legs really taste like chicken? A little, but because of the preparation, they also taste like snails, that is, full of garlic-butter! 30. Gratin Dauphinois I’ve never had bad Gratin Dauphinois: thinly sliced potatoes cooked in cream. The debate surrounding this staple of French cuisine is not who introduced it, but whether or not to add cheese. Purists insist the answer is no! Also, sometimes it is called Potatoes Dauphinoise. Originally plated with ortolan (a small fowl) in a meal prepared for the Lieutenant-General of the Dauphiné in 1788, this rich side dish pairs well with many meats and fish. Also sometimes called Potatoes Dauphinoise, this decadent side dish is regarded as a true gastronomic treat, and one of the French specialties loved by all. Gratin Dauphinois, a staple of French cuisine 31. Macarons Do not confuse the beloved famous food from France, Macaron, with the shredded coconut cookie, macaroon. Additionally, the colorful egg white meringue sandwiches that brighten the pâtisserie windows today differ from the original single-sided almond cookies of the 18th century. In recent years, the popularity of Macarons exploded worldwide, and their moment of glory shows no sign of diminishing anytime soon. Indeed, pastry chefs like Pierre Hermé are celebrating these delicacies of France by creating more and more creative flavors. 32. Madeleine French food historians disagree who the shell-shaped small cake knows as Madeleine is named after, but the wife of Louis XV made them fashionable in 1755. And in 2006, as one of the most famous French foods, they represented France in the European Union event, Café Europa. It’s a French food popular in every region. Buttery and nutty with ribs on one side and a bulging middle on the other, Madeleines commonly accompany tea and are served bump side up. 33. Millefeuille The French call it Millefeuille, but you may know it as a Napoleon. Pronounced “meel-foy,” the name of this French famous food means “1000 sheets,” referring to the many sheets of puff pastry used to create this classic confection, a favorite among French desserts. Three layers of pastry alternate with vanilla custard or pastry cream, and the top is coated with icing and a chocolate design, or sometimes powdered sugar. A couple of millefeuilles, the French famous food also known as Napoleons 34. Moules Frites Moules Frites, or Mussels and Fries, is a famous food France shares with Belgium, where it is a national dish. As for the “French fries,” it is widely accepted outside of France that french fries originated in Belgium. Nevertheless, Moules Frites can be found on restaurant menus throughout most regions of France, and it is one of the favorite meals of the French people. Walk down any Paris street lined with outdoor cafés and you’ll spot large pots of steamy mussels sitting on the tables. Likewise, in southern France, you can’t walk down the Cours Saleya in Nice without seeing a sign for a Moules Frites special. The most common preparation for the mussels in this famous French dish is Moules Marinière: shallots, butter, white wine, and parsley. If you order this main dish, be sure to try the French way of eating mussels—no fork, just use an empty mussel as tongs. It’s fun, and it really works! Moules Frites, the famous food France shares with Belgium 35. Omelettes Omelettes are one of the typical foods of France that Americans eat for breakfast, and the French eat as lunch or dinner. Many times plain, or simply stuffed with cheese, Omelettes in France most certainly contain butter, and that’s what makes them extraordinary. The best Omelette in France is said to be served at La Mère Poulard in Mont-Saint-Michel, where prices start at 34 euros each. 36. Onion Soup One of the only traditional French foods where onion is the main ingredient. Once the soup of the poor, French Onion Soup, or Soupe à l’Oignon, is now a globally popular food from France. A simple dish of caramelized onions, beef broth, croutons, and cheese, can be found as a starter in French cafés, restaurants, bistros, and brasseries. 37. Oysters A French favorite food for centuries, Oysters are usually consumed raw with mignonette sauce (minced shallots and vinegar). Among the best Oysters in the world, French Oysters fall into 2 categories: plates (flat shells) and creuse (curved shell). The majority of the plates oysters come from Brittany or at least France, but the creuse may be imported. Oysters served with mignonette sauce 38. Pain au Chocolat A chocolate-filled, flaky pastry similar to a croissant, Pain au Chocolat, or simply Pain Chocolat, dates back to 1830s Paris. With a slightly crispy outer layer and the combination of soft, buttery, layered dough and chocolate on the inside, Pains au Chocolat are sold in boulangeries throughout France. These scrumptious treats are a popular French food for breakfast or a snack and are best paired with coffee and enjoyed warm from the oven. Pain Chocolat, a popular French food for breakfast 39. Pâté In French cuisine, Pâté takes many forms: baked en croute (in a crust), sliced from a loaf, presented in a mold, or spread from a terrine. It can be course or smooth, and can be served warm or cold. Any way it’s prepared, the French love it! Pâté is commonly made from chopped or ground seasoned meats of pork, duck, or goose, and less frequently made of beef or fish. The most popular, Pâté de Foie Gras, uses duck or goose livers. Pâté often appears on French restaurant menus as a starter, as a snack at cafés, or packaged at the local butcher. Each one tastes different as chefs create their own recipes to showcase local flavors. House-made Pâté is popular in French cuisine 40. Pot au Feu The name Pot au Feu refers to the “pot on the fire,” rather than the hearty beef stew. Today, as one of the most traditional French dishes for a family meal, Pot au Feu is considered a national dish. Famous French meat dishes tend to be fall-apart-with-the-fork tender. This one is no exception. The combination of slow-cooked beef and vegetables like celery, turnips, carrots, parsnips, and onions can take all day to make—but are worth the wait. 41. Profiteroles Profiteroles are so closely related to cream puffs, some people do not distinguish between the two. Pastry chefs use the same pâte à choux dough to make light airy spheres filled with luscious creaminess. My rule of thumb, if it’s filled with ice cream, or larger than a silver dollar, it’s a profiterole. 42. Quenelle In French cooking, when you hear the term Quenelle, pronounced “ke-nel,” it may indicate one of two things: an egg-shaped fish dumpling, or something else like sorbet in the same shape. Since we’re talking about famous foods from France, I mean the dumpling. These are made from pureed fish mixed with egg, worked with spoons into the perfect shape, and then poached to perfection. The result is a magnificent, delicate treat you’ll want again and again. For a special version, head to Lyon, for their signature dish, Quenelle de brochet Nantua. A large brick-shaped Quenelle in crayfish sauce. It’s a great way to get your fill of this traditional French dish! A display of the famous French food, Quenelles at Les Halles de Lyon Paul Bocuse 43. Quiche Lorraine In France, real men do eat quiche! And at any time of day. The most famous, Quiche Lorraine, combines eggs, cream, and lardons (small pieces of bacon) in a savory crust. One of the traditional foods in France that became popular in the U.S. during the 1950s, Quiche Lorraine originated in the Alsace-Lorraine region. The king of quiche’s heyday continued through the 1970s, and May 20th became National Quiche Lorraine Day in the good ole USA. 44. Ratatouille In 2007, if you asked any American “What is France famous for?” Ratatouille would have been the answer. A traditional specialty from Nice, Ratatouille enjoyed its moment as the most famous French food when the Disney movie became an overnight sensation. However, this traditional vegetable stew of eggplant, zucchini, peppers, and tomatoes has been a popular food in France since the 1700’s. 45. Salade Niçoise Another of the most famous French dishes from Nice, Salade Niçoise showcases local ingredients: tuna, olives, tomatoes, anchovies, and hard boiled eggs. But you may be surprised that authentic recipes for the internationally popular food from France do not list cooked green beans or potatoes. Look for restaurants in Nice with the Cuisine Nissarde label for an authentic version! Salade Niçoise, a famous French dish from Nice 46. Sole Meunière Like many traditional dishes of France, Sole Meunière gets much of its flavor from butter. In this case, it’s brown butter, lemon, and parsley. Just say brown butter and I’m in! The fish is first dredged in flour and then sautéed in the buttery sauce. Julia Child called it "the most exciting meal of my life" in her memoir My Life in France, and the meal has been credited with inspiring her desire to pursue her chef career, during which she made much French food famous throughout the United States. 47. Soufflé If clouds were food, they’d be made of Soufflé. The word “soufflé” means “to puff up,” and whether they are sweet like chocolate, or savory like cheese, that is just what they do. The texture of any Soufflé teeters between meringue and custard, and divinely melts in your mouth. Infamous for being difficult to cook, the original recipe appeared in 1742. By 1845, new ovens facilitated the process of making these masterpieces, and with the help of chef Marie-Antoine Carême, the Soufflé solidified its place as a beloved famous food of Paris. A Grand Marnier Soufflé, a famous dessert from Paris 48. Steak Tartare On my last trip to France, I noticed the French ordering an abundance of Steak Tartare, raw minced ground beef. This is certainly a food famous in France, but the craze hasn’t yet made it to the States. If you do see it on a menu in America, it’s usually by a gourmet chef or at a high-end French restaurant. In France, it’s one of the most popular French dishes everywhere—from the neighborhood café to the finest restaurants in Paris. Usually the beef is seasoned and mixed with onion, and often topped with a raw egg yolk. 49. Tapenade Many people think Tapenade comes from Italy, but it is definitively a food that originated in France. This Provençal spread made from olives, anchovies, capers, olive oil, and garlic is most popular in the South of France, and has been incorporated into several other Mediterranean cuisines as well. The traditional French recipe resembles a puree, not pretty, but a tasty hors d’œuvre on crunchy bread, or as a condiment for chicken, beef, or fish. 50. Tarte Tatin In France, famous food sometimes comes with an amazing story. Culinary historians credit the Tatin sisters from the Hôtel Tatin in the Lamotte-Beuvron region with inventing this incredible French dessert. However, the sisters never called it that. The owner of the Paris restaurant Maxim stayed at the hotel and fell in love with the dessert. To get the recipe, he posed as a gardener. Fired 3 days later, he returned to Maxims, recipe in hand, where he dubbed it Tarte Tatin to honor the sisters. Made upside down with caramelized buttered apples, Tarte Tatin is best enjoyed warmed with ice cream. Hundreds of years later, it is still one of the best desserts in Paris, and a popular food of France. Tart Tatin warmed with ice cream, one of the best famous foods from France Why You Should Eat The Famous Food in France When traveling, I always advocate eating the local specialties. So, if you visit France, try some of these famous French foods! Even if you’re spending all of your time in the capital, famous French food in Paris is everywhere! Please note, traditional French dishes may not always be at the “in” restaurants, or what is considered “the best” restaurants in France. This is especially true in Paris, where fine dining appropriates more of a claim to the label “best” than is warranted. And in France, restaurants made popular with tourists by a mention in a guide book definitely do not guarantee the “best.” So, please, don’t trust the lines! During our last stay in Paris, we saw 3 restaurants with a queue: a burger place, an Italian restaurant, and a cheap restaurant with awful food. I know it was awful because we got suckered in! Restaurants don’t have to be famous or on a list to be good. The busy neighborhood cafés are where the locals go. Some of my favorite meals in Paris were at Café Bo Man, just down the street from our apartment for a month. This hidden gem in Paris served Escargot, Pâté, and the best Duck Confit for 12 euros!
